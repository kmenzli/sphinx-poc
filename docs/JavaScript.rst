Developing JavaScript
=====================

    This chapter discusses the right way to write your JavaScript code
    and include libraries in eXo Platform. How the code can be
    modularized to share and re-use, and how to avoid conflict as well
    is the main topic.

    The topic will be developed from the JavaScript primitive module
    patterns to the GateIn approach. You will walk through it by
    examples, from simple inline scripts to portlet applications. In
    this chapter:

    -  *`JavaScript module
       patterns <#PLFDevGuide.JavaScript.ModulePatterns>`__*

    -  *`AMD and
       RequireJS <#PLFDevGuide.JavaScript.AMD_and_RequireJS>`__*

    -  *`Shim configuration and Non-AMD
       modules <#PLFDevGuide.JavaScript.Shim_and_NonAMD>`__*

    -  *`GateIn Module Definition <#PLFDevGuide.JavaScript.GMD>`__*

    -  *`JQuery versions and
       plugins <#PLFDevGuide.JavaScript.JQuery>`__*

    A little knowledge of JavaScript is required, so if necessary, you
    should learn `JavaScript, W3
    Schools <http://www.w3schools.com/js/>`__ first.
