This form allows you to configure the **Forum** portlet in various
aspects via the following actions:

The following components can be enabled/disabled:

-  Show :ref:`Poll <Create-poll>`

-  Moderators

-  Show :ref:`Quick Reply <Posts.PostingQuickReply>`

-  Show Icons Legend

-  Show Rules

-  Show Statistics

.. _Enable-disable-bookmarkable-forum:

Enabling/Disabling a bookmarkable Forums URL
----------------------------------------------

Before doing this function, you first need to have knowledge of Ajax.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used in the **Forums**
application, aiming at updating a whole webpage or a part of the
webpage.

This feature defines how the links are generated in the **Forum**
portlet. You can select to use Ajax or not.

-  By not using Ajax, **Forums** will generate plain URLs in the links.
   The added benefit will be bookmarkability and better SEO as the links
   will be permalinks.

-  Using Ajax, the links will be Javascript based and generate Ajax
   calls. This makes your browsing faster because the whole page is not
   reloaded.
