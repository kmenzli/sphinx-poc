.. _SettingForumPermissions:

Setting forum permissions
--------------------------

While creating a new forum, you can assign the **moderator** role or
rights to start topics, add and view posts in the forum to specific
users/roles/groups. To do this, select the Permissions tab in the Forum
form and follow :ref:`this step <SettingCategoryPermission>`.

.. note:: -  When granting the "moderator" role to a specific user/role/group, to allow other users to start topics, add/view posts, you should uncheck these rights. The moderator of a forum only has right to manage the forum.

		  -  If you do not set the starting topics, posting, and viewing posts permissions for any users/roles/groups, and the category which includes the forum is not :ref:`set permissions <SettingCategoryPermission>`, it means all users can do these actions.

		  -  When granting any permissions above (moderate, start topics, post or only view posts in a forum), if you set the \* membership for the selected group, this permission will be granted to all users of that group, regardless of their membership role.
