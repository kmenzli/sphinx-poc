Using BBCodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BBCodes (Bulletin Board Codes) are special tags in bulletin boards that
help users enrich their posts with formatting and inclusions. They are
useful to provide guarded formatting capabilities to the forum users
without the risk of breaking the HTML markup of the page. BBCode itself
is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces "[" and
"]" rather than "<" and ">" and it offers greater control over what and
how something is displayed.

Depending on the :ref:`BBCode template customized <AdministrativeTasks.CustomizingBBcodes>`
by administrators only, you may find it very easy to add BBCodes to your
posts through a toolbar above the message area on the posting form. You
can either type the BBCode tags manually or use the toolbar in the
posting form. To easily get the BBCode tags without typing them, simply
click the respective icon which is shown on the toolbar above the
message area.
