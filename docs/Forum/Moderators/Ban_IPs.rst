.. _Banning-IPs:

Banning IPs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function allows banning IPs that may be used by users who abuse the
forum functions or violate the forum rules and policies.

This function is similar to the :ref:`Banning IPs tool used by
administrators <AdministrativeTasks.BanningIPs>`.
However, the Ban IPs tool used by administrators can ban IP from all
forums, while moderators can only ban IP from forums which he manages.

Do the :ref:`same actions <AdministrativeTasks.BanningIPs>` as the 
:ref:`Banning IPs <AdministrativeTasks.BanningIPs>` 
section of Administrators.
